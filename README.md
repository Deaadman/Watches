## GENERAL INFORMATION / FEATURES:
Watches is a modification which alters how time is told within [**The Long Dark**](https://www.hinterlandgames.com/the-long-dark/).

#### General Features
- **Digital Watch:** A watch which tells the precise time, but with the downfall of a battery.
- **Analog Watch:** A watch that tells the precise time, in analog format.
- **Stopwatch:** Similar to the analog watch, just not updated constantly.
- **Sundial:** An item alternative to watches with limited capabilities.

#### Gameplay Mechanics
- **Aurora:** The aurora can affect the display of the digital time, making it unusable - however it charges it in the process.
- **Condition:** If an items condition is too low, it begins to partially display the time - requiring to user to maintain their time pieces.
- **Freezing:** If any watch item gets over a certain freezing threshold, then the time freezes in place.
- **Watch Battery:** The Digital Watch has a battery, which is drained throughout its use.

#### HUD / UI Changes
- **Digital Time Indicator:** When wearing a digital watch, it now displays the current time down to the minute.
- **Analog Time Indicator:** When wearing an analog watch, or if a stopwatch is used - it displays a fully functional analog clock.
- **Vanilla TimeWidget Overhaul:** This is now disabled by default, and is only shown whenever a sundial is used.
- **Responds to Mechanics** There are different mechanics that can influence how the time is displayed throughout the game.
